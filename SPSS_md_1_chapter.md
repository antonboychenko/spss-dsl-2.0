# DSL SPSS 

## Part I: Foundations of data management 

Hello and welcome to the first SPSS workshop from the Digital Skills Lab at LSE. It is the first out of four workshops that will enable you to gain fundamental skills of working with SPSS. 
This session is dedicated to the fundamentals of data management. By the end of this session, you will learn how to:

- open existing SPSS datasets
- work with the SPSS interface
- import data from CSV and Excel to SPSS
- process the imported datasets
- recode variables
- compute new variables

It may sound like a lot, but it will take less than it seems. Letâ€™s go through them one by one. 

### Opening SPSS datasets

There is a high chance that you will be using a dataset that is already saved in the SPSS format, so you do not need to do any preprocessing and can use the file straight away. SPSS uses `.sav` extensions, and, for instance, the file that we will be using for our workshops is called **ESS5GB.sav**. This comes from the ESS ([European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org)), which is used in a lot of research (and may be useful in yours). We simply downloaded these data from the ESS in the SPSS format. 

You can use this file now. Simply double-click the **ESS5GB.sav** and wait till it loads (it might take some time). Once it is open you will see two wondows opened:

1. **The data editor**

![data editor](./img/data_edit.png)

This window is for you to access your data manipulate it and look through it. 

2. **The output**

![output window](./img/output.png)

This is an output window. SPSS warnings, messages and (what's important) all the results of your operations will be shown in this window.
